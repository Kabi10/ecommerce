## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST ‚ö†Ô∏è
STOP! Before writing ANY code or suggesting ANY changes:

1. üîç SEARCH FIRST (REQUIRED):
   ```bash
   # Document ALL search results below
   grep_search "[feature keyword]" # Search for related functionality
   file_search "[filename pattern]" # Search for similar files
   list_dir "[relevant directory]" # List contents of relevant directories
   ```

2. üìù DOCUMENT FINDINGS (REQUIRED):
   ```markdown
   ## Existing Files Found:
   - [List all relevant files found with full paths]
   - [Include file sizes and last modified dates if relevant]
   
   ## Existing Functionality:
   - [Describe what already exists in detail]
   - [Note any patterns or architectural approaches used]
   
   ## Gaps Identified:
   - [List what's missing or needs enhancement]
   - [Identify technical debt or issues in existing code]
   
   ## Implementation Decision Tree:
   - Is there existing code that serves this purpose? [Yes/No]
   - Can existing code be enhanced to meet requirements? [Yes/No]
   - Is creating new code justified? [Yes/No, with reasoning]
   
   ## Proposed Approach:
   - [ ] Enhance existing code at [file path]
   - [ ] Create new files (requires detailed justification)
   - [ ] Refactor existing code at [file path]
   
   ## Implementation Plan:
   1. [First step with estimated effort]
   2. [Second step with estimated effort]
   3. [Additional steps as needed]
   ```

3. ‚úã WAIT FOR APPROVAL:
   - Present findings to user with clear options
   - Get explicit approval for chosen approach
   - Never proceed with new files if similar functionality exists
   - Document approval in the implementation plan

‚ùå IF YOU SKIP THIS CHECKLIST, YOU ARE VIOLATING THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE ‚ùå

## Instructions

- Record fixes for mistakes or corrections to avoid repetition in the `Lessons` section.
- Organize thoughts and plan steps before starting a task in the `Scratchpad` section.
- Clear old tasks if necessary.
- Use todo markers for progress tracking:
  - `[X]` Completed tasks
  - `[ ]` Pending tasks
- Update Scratchpad after completing subtasks.
- Reflect and plan after milestones for better task management.
- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.
- ALWAYS CHECK FOR EXISTING FILES BEFORE CREATING NEW ONES TO AVOID DUPLICATES.

## Lessons

### üñ•Ô∏è UI/UX Best Practices
- Use `npx shadcn@latest add [component]` for Shadcn UI components
- Maintain consistent page layouts (p-6 padding, mb-8 header spacing)
- For loading states: create skeleton components, use Suspense, show indicators for async operations
- For forms: handle loading states with local state, disable inputs during submission
- For filters/search: use URL params, implement debouncing, create separate filter components

### üîÑ Next.js Patterns
- Page props params must be typed as a Promise in Next.js 14+
- Use `const session = await auth()` instead of `getServerSession(authOptions)`
- Mark components using `useRouter` with `'use client'` directive
- Components using `useSearchParams()` must be client components wrapped in Suspense
- When using dynamic imports with `next/dynamic`, set `ssr: false` for client-only components

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines
- Keep layouts simple: structural elements in layout.tsx, page-specific UI in page.tsx
- For client components with search params: create separate content component, use loading fallback
- For client-side state: extract state display into client components, use dynamic imports with `ssr: false`
- Pass search params as props from server components instead of using `useSearchParams()` directly
- Handle auth properly: use middleware for protection, include callback URLs, use role-based access

### üß© TypeScript Tips
- Convert Prisma's Decimal to number using `Number(price)` to match expected types
- Use union types for nullable fields (e.g., `string | null`)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Process Requirements
- ALWAYS check for existing implementations before creating new files
- Use grep_search/file_search to look for similar file names and functionality
- Document search process in scratchpad before implementing features
- NEVER skip the pre-implementation checklist to avoid duplicate code

## Build Error Prevention Rules

1. Next.js Configuration Best Practices:
   - Keep `next.config.js` clean and minimal
   - Use `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` and `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` only temporarily
   - Configure proper image domains in `remotePatterns`
   - Set appropriate `experimental` features carefully

2. Client Component Rules:
   - Always use 'use client' directive for components with hooks
   - Wrap client components in Suspense boundaries
   - Use dynamic imports for heavy client-side components
   - Provide loading states for all async operations

3. Build Process Requirements:
   - Run `npm run clean` before builds
   - Check for type errors with `tsc --noEmit`
   - Monitor build logs for warnings
   - Keep dependencies updated weekly

4. Error Resolution Steps:
   - Check type definitions first
   - Verify import paths
   - Ensure proper Suspense boundaries
   - Validate environment variables
   - Review API endpoint configurations

5. Performance Optimization Rules:
   - Use dynamic imports for large components
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Monitor bundle sizes

6. SEO and Sitemap Rules:
   - Maintain proper next-sitemap.config.js
   - Update meta tags and descriptions
   - Configure robots.txt appropriately
   - Exclude sensitive routes

7. Development Workflow:
   - Use proper TypeScript types
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add loading states
   - Test in both development and production

8. Authentication and API Rules:
   - Use proper error handling
   - Implement proper session management
   - Handle edge cases and loading states
   - Validate all user inputs

9. Required Scripts in package.json:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "next dev",
       "build": "prisma generate && next build",
       "postbuild": "next-sitemap",
       "start": "next start",
       "lint": "next lint",
       "clean": "rimraf .next out",
       "prebuild": "npm run clean",
       "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
     }
   }
   ```

10. Required Development Dependencies:
    - rimraf (for cleaning build artifacts)
    - next-sitemap (for sitemap generation)
    - typescript (for type checking)
    - eslint and related plugins

## Critical Standards

### Version Control Standards
- Never commit directly to main/master
- Branch naming: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/` prefixes
- Commit messages must reference task/issue numbers
- Squash commits before merging to main
- Delete branches after merging

### Rollback Procedures
- Keep deployment artifacts for last 3 successful builds
- Document rollback commands in deployment scripts
- Maintain database migration reversions
- Keep configuration backups
- Test rollback procedures monthly

### Performance Budgets
- Page Load: < 3s on 4G
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Bundle Size: < 200KB initial JS
- API Response: < 300ms
- Image Optimization: WebP/AVIF with fallbacks
- Core Web Vitals minimum:
  - LCP: < 2.5s
  - FID: < 100ms
  - CLS: < 0.1

### Dependency Management
- Weekly security audit: `npm audit`
- Monthly dependency updates
- Keep lockfile clean (no duplicate packages)
- Document breaking changes
- Test suite must pass after updates
- Update order: 
  1. Security patches
  2. Core dependencies (Next.js, React)
  3. UI components
  4. Dev dependencies

## File Creation Checklist
Before creating any new file or component:
1. Search for existing files with similar names:
   ```bash
   # Example searches
   grep_search for functionality
   file_search for similar files
   list_dir in relevant directories
   ```
2. Search for similar functionality:
   - Check obvious locations (e.g., components/, app/)
   - Search for related terms in the codebase
   - Look for similar features in different directories
3. If similar exists:
   - Document why enhancement/replacement is needed
   - Get explicit approval for creating a new version
   - Ensure no functionality is lost in the process
4. Document the search process:
   - What terms were searched
   - What files were found
   - Why existing files were not suitable
   - Why a new file is necessary
